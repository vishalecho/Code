# Code
The nature of code course offered by Daniel Shiffman

#### DESCRIPTION
##### Can we capture the unpredictable evolutionary and emergent properties of nature in software? 
##### Can understanding the mathematical principles behind our physical world help us to create digital worlds? 

*This course focuses on the programming strategies and techniques behind computer simulations of natural systems. This Repository will host all the coursework projects examples are demonstrated using the ![p5.js](http://p5js.org/) environment with a focus on object oriented programming..*

*Will be exploring the topics ranging from basic mathematics and physics concepts to more advanced simulations of complex systems. Subjects covered include physics simulation, trigonometry, fractals, cellular automata, self-organization, and genetic algorithms.*
